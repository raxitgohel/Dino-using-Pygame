# Dino-using-Pygame
This Pygame project features a simplified version of the Dino game of Chrome. Here a player controls a character to navigate hurdles, earn points, and use power-ups. The game includes jumping mechanics, sound effects, and a scoring system. Players can also shoot fireballs to overcome obstacles.
